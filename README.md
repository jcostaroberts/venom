# venom

I couldn't find a way to export Venmo my transaction history other than downloading the webpage and processing into a CSV.

Usage:

venmoparse.py [-h] -i INFILE -o OUTFILE -u USERNAME [-y YEAR]

Output:

Name,Note,Date,Amount  
Daniel R,for your troubles ;),2016-09-22,$12.00  
Sarah Applefarmer,bushel of apples,2016-09-21,-$40
